# PROJECT IDEA
Developing a game called AlterPastel, It is a quiz themed game where players can participate by entering a nickname and start answering questions to gain points. Each player is stored into the Database and has score. Overall, will be compiled into a leader board (Separate page). Questions can be customised by quiz creator; each quiz will have QuizID. Will redirect to leader board, show current position. Question timing will be around 30 seconds. After timer runs out, the player will no longer be able to choose any options in the quiz. Thus, it will be taken as an incorrect answer and no points will be awarded, and the correct answer will be showed. The background colour is JS and will alternate between some colours with the help of JavaScript. Hence, name of game is chosen as AlterPastel.
